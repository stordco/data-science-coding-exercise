Data Scientist Coding Exercise

## Preparation of the Assessment Environment
- All coding exercises have been verified using Google Colab https://colab.research.google.com/
- It is suggested that you as well use Google Colab but please feel free to use whatever platform or coding environment you feel most comfortable with.
- Ensure that your coding platform (e.g., Google Colab) is set up and fully functional.
- Confirm that the development environment has the necessary libraries pre-installed (e.g., Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook).
- The 3 CSV files are included in this repository. They will be needed for this exercise.
- Once completed, please share your colab notebook or zip up the code and email it to the Stord talent acquisition team member you have been working with.

## Statistical Inference
**Model Building and Evaluation**
- You are provided with a dataset from a marketing campaign. The dataset includes user_id, age, income, previous_purchases, and purchase (1 if the user made a purchase, 0 otherwise).
- Your task is to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on the provided features.

**Instructions**
1. Load the dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a logistic regression model on the training set.
4. Evaluate the model on the testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. Output the evaluation metrics.

**Expected Output**
Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

**Dataset**
